# Recode Info

For now, I will be pointing all of the mod pages here to keep everything up to date easier.

For the 1.18+ copies, I have done a complete recode of the mod however reused the old textures models and sounds.

## Christmas release
Note: This has been delayed though is almost ready so that I can relax a little more over the Christmas holidays. The first update starting to show the new systems in 1.18 should be coming out in the first week of the new year.

I plan to release a copy around Christmas showing the basics of the new systems minus the animation system.
That will be high on the priority list once most of the old jutsus are back.

For more info, check the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/qMqwZMkU/naruto-mod).

Some parts may not be added for the christmas release but will be added shortly after and to save time will be partially ported into the new ability system.

The plan is to revamp and add new particle effects and alter parts however trying to get it back up to speed I may port some parts over just to get the content in before re-introducing it.

## Versioning going forwards
Rather than following the general Minecraft updating logic (never changing the 1.x.x). I will follow the general software versioning logic to help with other modders making addons. For those who don't know what this means, versions are major.minor.patch and I have provided a mini summary of those below.
### What do these mean?
#### Patch (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
Fixes for bugs, no extra content.

#### Minor (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
Additional features. This can be new items and usable content or possibly new functions available for devs to make addons/interact with the mod.

#### Major (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
Large changes, if it be commands, NBT changes or API changes. These will likely break addons and/or you may lose data from your world though I will try to add upgrade code to minimise this.

## From now on
Rather than large content updates, I plan to release content as it is created to avoid burnout and large gaps where no updates are seen for months/years.
I am also welcoming others to help with the mod and will be writing some guides on contributing translations and other various aspects depending on the help offered.

I will add more info here soon; I just wanted to get a basic page up explaining the start of the info.
