# Recode Info

For now, I will be pointing all of the mod pages here to keep everything up to date easier.

For the 1.18+ copies, I have done a complete recode of the mod however reused the old textures models and sounds.

## Tasks & Priorities

You can find an up to date list of tasks and plans [here](https://github.com/users/sekwah41/projects/1/views/1).

## Current Content
A lot is missing vs the 1.7 version however we will be adding it in the coming months.

This is especially important for anyone planning to do YouTube videos with this.
Please mention if it's a review that a lot will be missing as we've just started releasing 1.18.

For the initial 1.18 release there are some of the items, armour and jutsus.

There is currently no GUI in game to find these but `/jutsu list` now exists :)

## Versioning going forwards
Rather than following the general Minecraft updating logic (never changing the 1.x.x). I will follow the general software versioning logic to help with other modders making addons. For those who don't know what this means, versions are major.minor.patch and I have provided a mini summary of those below.
### What do these mean?
#### Patch (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
Fixes for bugs, no extra content.

#### Minor (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
Additional features. This can be new items and usable content or possibly new functions available for devs to make addons/interact with the mod.

#### Major (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
Large changes, if it be commands, NBT changes or API changes. These will likely break addons and/or you may lose data from your world though I will try to add upgrade code to minimise this.

## From now on
Rather than large content updates, I plan to release content as it is created to avoid burnout and large gaps where no updates are seen for months/years.
I am also welcoming others to help with the mod and will be writing some guides on contributing translations and other various aspects depending on the help offered.

I will add more info here soon; I just wanted to get a basic page up explaining the start of the info.
