# Recode Info

For now I will be pointing all of the mod pages to here so that I can keep everything up to date easier.

For the 1.18+ copies I have done a complete recode of the mod however reused the old textures models and sounds.

## Christmas release
I plan to release a copy around Christmas showing of the basics of the new systems minus the animation system.
Though that will be high on the priority list once most of the old jutsus are back.

For more info check the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/qMqwZMkU/naruto-mod).

## Going forward
Rather than large content updates I plan to release content as it is created to avoid burnout and large gaps where no updates are seen for months/years.
I am also welcoming others to help with the mod and will be writing some guides on how to contribute translations and other various aspects depending on the help offered.

I will add more info here soon, I just wanted to get a basic page up explaining the start of the info.
