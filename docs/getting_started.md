# Getting Started


At the moment there is no dedicated path for starting with the mod.
Though we have included recipes with unlock conditions for use with the vanilla recipe system.

If you want to find all the recipes and items available, you can use a mod such as JEI


**Quick notice:** This website is majorly WIP so a lot of info needs editing or adding. Feel free to ask questions on the [Discord](https://discord.sekwah.com).
Make sure to check the [FAQ](./faq.md) on here and in `#naruto-faq` on the server.

## Update content info
You can find a changelog about what has changed in each version and when they were released [here](https://github.com/sekwah41/Naruto-Mod/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## How to become a ninja
To add the abiity to choose if you are a ninja you will now need to press J to then select to become a ninja. We will be modifying this in the future but this is a placeholder for now.

## Jutsus/Abilities
To see a list of the currently available jutsus/abilities, type `/jutsu list`.
This will show you a list containing the names of the abilities and their key combos.

Some abilities will have additional requirements such as channelling, or a cooldown. More info can be found [here](./jutsus_and_abilities.md).
