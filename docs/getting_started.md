If you want to find all the recipes and items available, you can use a mod such as JEI


**Quick notice:** This website is majorly WIP so a lot of info needs editing or adding. Feel free to ask questions on the [Discord](https://discord.sekwah.com).
Make sure to check the [FAQ](./faq.md) on here and in `#naruto-faq` on the server.

## Jutsus/Abilities
To see a list of the currently available jutsus/abilities, type `/jutsu list`.
This will show you a list containing the names of the abilities and their key combos.

Some abilities will have additional requirements such as channelling, or a cooldown. More info can be found [here](./jutsus.md).
